## Education

* **[Mar. 2020 ~ Aug. 2025]** : Ph.D. in School of Electrical Engineering @ KAIST.
* **[Mar. 2015 ~ Feb. 2020]** : B.S. in School of Electrical Engineering @ KAIST - **Graduated Cum Laude**.
* **[Mar. 2013 ~ Feb. 2015]** : Gyeongnam Science High School.

## Work Experience

* **[Mar. 2018 ~ Aug. 2018]:** AI Research Intern @ Koh Young Technology

## Research Interests

* **Diffusion Model Architecture:** Reimagine diffusion training as a multi-task learning, and introduce how to 
synergize the training of multiple denoising tasks. [[ICLR'24]](https://byeongjun-park.github.io/DTR/)
[[ECCV'24]](https://byeongjun-park.github.io/Switch-DiT/) [[AAAI'25]](https://sangminwoo.github.io/DMP/)
* **3D Generation:** Create high-quality 3D objects and scenes by using generative models such as GAN, diffusion, rectivied flow models, 
and lifting them into neural scene representations, such as point clouds, NeRF, and 3DGS. [[TPAMI'24]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475596)
[[CVPR'24]](https://byeongjun-park.github.io/HarmonyView/) [[CVPR'25]](https://gohyojun15.github.io/SplatFlow/)
* **X-Series:** My long-term goal is to seamlessly integrate generative models with neural scene representations to create high-quality 3D/4D worlds.  [[SteerX]](https://byeongjun-park.github.io/SteerX/) is the first step in this journey.
