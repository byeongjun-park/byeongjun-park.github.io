## Research Interests

* **Diffusion Model Architecture:** Reimagine diffusion training as a multi-task learning, and introduce how to 
synergize the training of multiple denoising tasks. [[ICLR'24]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=MY0qlcFcUg)
[[ECCV'24]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09176.pdf) [[AAAI'25]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17825)
* **Image-to-3D:** Solve practical problems in generating 3D scenes or objects from a single image, focusing on
balancing the preservation of given contents and the realistic genreation of novel views. [[TPAMI'24]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475596)
[[CVPR'24]](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Woo_HarmonyView_Harmonizing_Consistency_and_Diversity_in_One-Image-to-3D_CVPR_2024_paper.html)
* **Text-to-3D:** Currently, I am interested in direct generation of 3D Gaussian Splatting only from text prompts. [[CVPR'25]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16443)
